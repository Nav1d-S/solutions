Enter your answers to the questions from the homework below:
Without any changes, does it seem that the game favors one type of roll? If so, what.
The game would favor odd rolls instead of even rolls, as when you roll odd then there is only
one instance where you lose, but if you roll even there are two instances where you lose.

Can you change that outcome by just changing the number of sides on the die?
If so, how many sides did you change it to.
No changing the amount of sides has no significant effect on the outcomes.   

Going back to a 12 sided die, can you change that outcome by just changing the fail values?
If so, what values did you change it to?
Yes as if even or odd have more a diff fail value they would then be either more fair or unfair
For example changing the fail value of evens to 1 and odds to 2 results in evens having more wins

Modify whatever values youâ€™d like, can you make the game fair
(that is, neither even nor odd have a greater advantage). What values did you change?
I had changed the failvalues for both even and odd to 1 and had both of them have 6 dicerolls each.
